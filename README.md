Library Management system:
This project deals with small library management system. In this I have concentrate on implementing oops concept.

We have menu. 
 To Display
 To Borrow a book
 To return a book
 To exit

Based on menu it will display books in our record and
on borrow we can choose books to collect.
On return it will ask for name and then return 
All the details get stored in files called borrow and return.

On exit it will exit.
